No file should exceed 150 lines unless absolutely necessary.

If a file becomes long, split it immediately into smaller files.

Do not put UI, logic, models, utilities, and theme elements in the same file.

Widgets must be moved to separate reusable components.

Theme, colors, spacing, typography must always be in separate files.

Large Views must be broken into partials/ folder widgets.
